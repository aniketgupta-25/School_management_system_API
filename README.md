This README provides the steps required to set up and execute a Node.js project. Follow the instructions below to get your environment ready for development and deployment of the Node.js application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. *Node.js* - Ensure that Node.js is installed. You can verify this by running the following command:

       node -v

If Node.js is not installed, download and install the latest LTS version from nodejs.org.

npm - npm (Node Package Manager) comes installed with Node.js. Verify by running:

     npm -v

If npm is not installed, it will be included when you install Node.js.

Git - Git is used for version control, and you may need it to clone repositories. Verify by running:

git --version

If you don’t have Git, you can download it from git-scm.com.

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git. Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of your project repository.

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

2. Install Dependencies
Once inside the project directory, install all necessary dependencies by running:

        npm install

This will install the required packages listed in package.json and prepare the application for execution.

3. Environment Configuration

Some applications may require environment variables for configuration (e.g., database connections, API keys). You can set them up by:

Copying the .env.example file to .env (if applicable):

      cp .env.example .env

Editing the .env file to match your environment, such as providing API keys, database URLs, etc.

4. Run the Application
Once dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, you can run the application locally by executing:

        npm start

This will start the application on the default port specified in the code (usually port 3000 or as defined in .env).

6. Running Tests (Optional)
If the project includes tests, you can run them using:

       npm test
Make sure you have any necessary testing dependencies installed (if applicable) by running npm install first.

Available Commands
npm start: Starts the application in production mode (usually by running node <entry-point-file>).
npm run dev: Starts the application in development mode, typically with auto-reloading (e.g., using nodemon).
npm test: Runs unit tests using the defined testing framework (e.g., Mocha, Jest).
npm run build: Builds the project for production (if applicable).
npm run lint: Runs a linter to check for code quality issues.

Troubleshooting
Port Conflict: If the application is already running on the default port (e.g., 3000), you can change the port in the .env file or in the application’s configuration.

Missing Dependencies: If you encounter missing module errors, try running npm install again to ensure all dependencies are installed.

Permission Errors: If you receive permission errors when running commands, try running the command as an administrator (on Windows) or with sudo (on macOS/Linux).
